**TODO: Better explain in one sentence what this is and what its purpose is**

The `Continue Core` connects the [SDK](./sdk.md) and [GUI](./gui.md) with the [IDE](./ide.md) (i.e. in VS Code, GitHub Codespaces, a web browser text editor, etc), enabling the steps to make changes to your code and accelerate your software development workflows.
