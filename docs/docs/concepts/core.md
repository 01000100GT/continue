# Core

*TODO: Explain in detail what this is and what its purpose is*

## One sentence definition

The `Continue Core` connects the [SDK](./sdk.md) and [GUI](./gui.md) with the [IDE](./ide.md) (i.e. in VS Code, GitHub Codespaces, a web browser text editor, etc), enabling the steps to make changes to your code and accelerate your software development workflows.

## What else to know

The `Core` includes

- IDE protocol
- GUI protocol
- SDK
- Autopilot

There is a two-way sync between an IDE and the GUI that happens through Core.

**Q: does this make sense as a concept?**
