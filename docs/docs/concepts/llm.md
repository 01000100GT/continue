## What else to know


*TODO: Explain in detail what this is and what its purpose is*

`LLM` is the large language model that can be used in steps to automate that require some judgement based on context (e.g. generating code based on docs, explaining an error given a stack trace, etc)

**Q: should we call this LLM? Perhaps just model?**

**Q: should this abstraction be connected to autopilot?**
