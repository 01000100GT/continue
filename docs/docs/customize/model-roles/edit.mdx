It's often useful to select a different model to respond to Edit prompts than for chat prompts, as Edits are often more code-specific and may require less conversational readability.

In Continue, you can add `edit` to a model's roles to specify that it can be used for Edit requests. If no edit models are specified, the selected `chat` model is used.
