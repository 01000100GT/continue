### Slash commands

While many Actions are based on templated prompts and can be customized with .prompt files, there are a number that execute more complex code under the hood.

Slash commands can be combined with additional instructions, including [context providers](../context-providers.mdx) or [highlighted code](../../edit/context-selection#highlighted-code).

The easiest way to add actions is by adding [`prompt` blocks](../../hub/blocks/block-types.md#prompts) to your assistant, which show up as slash commands in [Chat](../chat/how-it-works.md).

The most common way to invoke an action is with a slash command. These are shortcuts that can be activated by typing '/' in a chat session (press <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains)), and selecting from the dropdown.

In YAML assistants, slash commands are generated from [`prompts` blocks](../hub/blocks/block-types.md#prompts).

:::info
Important: For assistants, slash commands only come from `prompts` blocks. When using older `config.json` configuration, other slash commands like `/share` and `/cmd` are included by default.
:::

### Prompt files

It is also possible to write your own slash command by defining a “.prompt file.” Prompt files can be as simple as a text file, but also include templating so that you can refer to files, URLs, highlighted code, and more.

Learn more about prompt files [here](./prompt-files.md)

:::info
Slash commands can currently only be added using [`config.json`](../json-reference.md). The [`YAML Config Format`](../reference.md) is the new and preferred format. We recommend looking into [Prompt Files](../customize/deep-dives/prompt-files.md) to achieve similar functionality.
:::

Slash commands are shortcuts that can be activated by typing '/' and selecting from the dropdown. For example, the built-in '/edit' slash command lets you stream edits directly into your editor.

## Built-in Slash Commands

To use any of the built-in slash commands, open `config.json` and add it to the `slashCommands` list.

### `/share`

Generate a shareable markdown transcript of your current chat history.

```json title="config.json"
{
  "slashCommands": [
    {
      "name": "share",
      "description": "Export the current chat session to markdown",
      "params": { "outputDir": "~/.continue/session-transcripts" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `outputDir` parameter to specify where you want to the markdown file to be saved.

### `/cmd`

Generate a shell command from natural language and (only in VS Code) automatically paste it into the terminal.

```json title="config.json"
{
  "slashCommands": [
    {
      "name": "cmd",
      "description": "Generate a shell command"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `/commit`

Shows the LLM your current git diff and asks it to generate a commit message.

```json title="config.json"
{
  "slashCommands": [
    {
      "name": "commit",
      "description": "Generate a commit message for the current changes"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `/http`

Write a custom slash command at your own HTTP endpoint. Set 'url' in the params object for the endpoint you have setup. The endpoint should return a sequence of string updates, which will be streamed to the Continue sidebar. See our basic [FastAPI example](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/74002369a5e435735b83278fb965e004ae38a97d/core/context/providers/context_provider_server.py#L34-L45) for reference.

```json title="config.json"
{
  "slashCommands": [
    {
      "name": "http",
      "description": "Does something custom",
      "params": { "url": "<my server endpoint>" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `/issue`

Describe the issue you'd like to generate, and Continue will turn into a well-formatted title and body, then give you a link to the draft so you can submit. Make sure to set the URL of the repository you want to generate issues for.

```json title="config.json"
{
  "slashCommands": [
    {
      "name": "issue",
      "description": "Generate a link to a drafted GitHub issue",
      "params": { "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/continuedev/continue" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `/onboard`

The onboard slash command helps to familiarize yourself with a new project by analyzing the project structure, READMEs, and dependency files. It identifies key folders, explains their purpose, and highlights popular packages used. Additionally, it offers insights into the project's architecture.

```json title="config.json"
{
  "slashCommands": [
    {
      "name": "onboard",
      "description": "Familiarize yourself with the codebase"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard proposed by Anthropic to unify prompts, context, and tool use. Continue supports MCP "prompts" by creating slash commands. Read their [quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) to learn how to set up a local server and then set up your configuration like this:

<Tabs groupId="config-example">
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  mcpServers:
    - name: My MCP Server
      command: uvx
      args:
        - mcp-server-sqlite
        - --db-path
        - /Users/NAME/test.db
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json" label="JSON">
  ```json title="config.json"
  {
    "experimental": {
      "modelContextProtocolServers": [
        {
          "transport": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/Users/NAME/test.db"]
          }  
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
