For the best autocomplete experience we recommend Codestral from Mistral.

Add Codestral to your assistant from the hub [here](https://hub.continue.dev/mistral/codestral). Visit the [Mistral Platform](https://console.mistral.ai/codestral) to get a Codestral API key.

For more details about setup and recommended models, visit the [autocomplete deep dive](../customize/deep-dives/autocomplete.mdx).
