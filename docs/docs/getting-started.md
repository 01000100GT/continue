# Getting started

## GitHub Codespaces Demo

**TODO: Add `Open in GitHub Codespaces` badge here**

1. Click the `Open in GitHub Codespaces` badge above

:::tip
 We don't want to waste your time with install and env setup before you try Continue, so we set up a GitHub Codespaces dev container for you, which **wonâ€™t cost you anything**. If you are using GitHub Free for personal accounts, you can [use Codespaces for 120 hours per month for free](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts)

2. Select the `Create new codespace` button and wait a couple minutes for it to launch and then install the Continue extension. It should look like this one it is complete:

**TODO: Insert an image of Continue when it has opened**

3. Try playing with Continue as you build a Python script to do Pandas stuff

**TODO: Design and set up Pandas stuff scenario in codespaces**

4. There are a few recipes you should also try
a. In the first directory, try out X recipe
b. In the second directory, try out Y recipe
c. In the third directory, try out Z recipe

- database migrations
- something super simple (libaries)
- unit testing

**TODO: Design and add these recipes in codespaces**

## Next Steps

If you would prefer to use Continue locally, we reccommend installing `Continue` packaged as a VS Code extension as described [here](./install.md).

Otherwise, if you would like to continue to use Continue on GitHub Codespaces, then you should now go through the walkthroughs:
- How to [use the GUI](./walkthroughs/use-the-gui.md)
- How to [use a recipe](./walkthroughs/use-a-recipe.md)
- How to [create a recipe](./walkthroughs/create-a-recipe.md)
- How to [share a recipe](./walkthroughs/share-a-recipe.md)
