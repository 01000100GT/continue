If you would prefer to use Continue locally, we reccommend installing `Continue` packaged as a VS Code extension as described [here](./install.md).

Otherwise, if you would like to continue to use GitHub Codespaces, then you should now go through the walkthroughs:
- How to [use the GUI](./walkthroughs/use-the-gui.md)
- How to [use a recipe](./walkthroughs/use-a-recipe.md)
- How to [create a recipe](./walkthroughs/create-a-recipe.md)
- How to [share a recipe](./walkthroughs/share-a-recipe.md)
