# Use a Block

Blocks can be used by adding the to assistants. See

- [Create an assistant](../assistants/create-an-assistant.md)
- [Edit an assistant](../assistants/edit-an-assistant.md)

Some blocks require inputs. If you are missing an input for a block, a notification icon will show in the sidebar next to the block. Click the notification to select which secret to use for the block input.
