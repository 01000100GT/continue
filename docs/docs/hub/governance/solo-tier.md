# Solo Tier

The solo tier allows individuals to create and share custom AI code assistants, which you can use with our open-source VS Code and JetBrains extensions. You can use your own API keys for commercial LLMs or bring your own compute + models. You can create organizations, invite others to join, and make custom AI code assistants available to each other. Everyone will have to bring their own user secrets.

Blocks and assistants across both your profile and any organizations can have one of the following visibilities: public (Anyone on the internet), organization (Only visible to members of your organization), or private (Only you and admins of your organization). Since you only use user secrets on the solo tier, they will be sent to the IDE extensions alongside the config.yaml. This allows requests to APIs to be made directly from the IDE extensions.
