# Enterprise Tier

Everything in the solo tier and teams tier are available in the enterprise tier. In addition, enterprises can manage users from a single, central directory with Single Sign-On (SSO) via any IdP supporting SAML or OIDC, and admins can see a detailed trail of account activity with Audit Logs. There is also onboarding and training to roll out to your entire organization (will be set up with the sales team at Continue).
