# Organization Permissions

Users can have the following roles within an organization:

1. Admin: users who can invite members, delete the organization, etc.
2. Member: users who can use approved blocks and assistants

Exact user permissions depend on the organization tier:

- [Solo](./solo-tier.md)
- [Teams](./teams-tier.md)
- [Enterprise](./enterprise-tier.md)
