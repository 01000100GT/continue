# Create an Assistant

## Remix an assistant

You should remix an assistant if you want to use it after some modifications.

By clicking the “remix” button, you’ll be taken to the “Create a remix” page.

Once here, you’ll be able to:

1. Add or remove blocks in YAML configuration
2. Change the name, description, icon, etc.

Clicking “Create assistant” will make this assistant available for use.

## Create an assistant from scratch

To create an assistant from scratch, click “New assistant” in the top bar.

Choose a name, slug, description, and icon for your assistant.

Then, you can edit the assistant YAML directly before clicking "Create assistant" to make it available for use. To edit the YAML directly, refer to examples of assistants on [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/assistants) and visit the [YAML Reference](../../yaml-reference.md#complete-yaml-config-example) for more details.

You can also go ahead and Create the Assistant and then edit it using the sidebar.
