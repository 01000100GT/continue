# Create an Assistant

## Remix an assistant

You should remix an assistant if you want to use it after some modifications.

By clicking the “remix” button, you’ll be taken to the “Create a remix” page.

Once here, you’ll be able to
Add or remove blocks in YAML configuration
Change name, description, icon, etc.

Clicking “Create assistant” will make this assistant available for use

## Create an assistant from scratch

To create an assistant from scratch, you will need to click “New assistant” in the top bar.

After filling out information on the assistant, you will want to determine which blocks you want to include and then reference them following the config.yaml reference documentation.

If a block you want to use does not exist yet, you’ll want to first create that block.

There are many examples of assistants on hub.continue.dev, or view the [YAML Reference](../../yaml-reference.md#complete-yaml-config-example) for more details.
