# Continue Hub

![Continue Hub](/img/hub/models-page.png)

Continue's [hub](https://hub.continue.dev) makes it simple to create custom AI code [assistants](./assistants/intro.md), providing a registry for defining, managing, and sharing assistant [building blocks](./blocks/introduction.md). Assistants can contain several types of blocks, including models, rules, context, prompts, docs, data destinations, and MCP servers. Continue Hub offers [organization and admin governance](./governance/org-permissions.md) features, as well as a centralized place to store and configure [secrets](./secrets/secret-types.md) like API keys.
