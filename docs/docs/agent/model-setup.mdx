For the best Agent experience we recommend Claude 3.7 Sonnet from Anthropic.

Add Claude 3.7 Sonnet to your assistant from the hub [here](https://hub.continue.dev/anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet). You can get an API key from the [Anthropic console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

The best chat models generally support tool usage. See [recommended chat models](../customize/model-roles/chat.mdx#recommended-chat-models) for more.
