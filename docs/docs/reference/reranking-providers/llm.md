title: LLM
---

If you only have access to a single LLM, then you can use it as a reranker. This is discouraged unless truly necessary, because it will be much more expensive and still less accurate than any of the above models trained specifically for the task. Note that this will not work if you are using a local model, for example with Ollama, because too many parallel requests need to be made.

```json title="~/.continue/config.json"
{
  "reranker": {
    "name": "llm",
    "params": {
      "modelTitle": "My Model Title"
    }
  }
}
```

The `"modelTitle"` field must match one of the models in your "models" array in config.json.
